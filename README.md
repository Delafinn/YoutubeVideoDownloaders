# Welcome to YoutubeVideoDownloader!

Make sure to `pip install pytube` from your command line. 

Scripts that will download a playlist of youtube videos or download a single youtube video.

**youtube_playlist_downloader** and **youtube_downloader** have the option to only install audio versions rather than just video. 

Lastly, Make sure to create a new folder/directory and place these python scripts inside your new directory. Videos that are downloaded are going to be downloaded to the same directory as these scripts.
